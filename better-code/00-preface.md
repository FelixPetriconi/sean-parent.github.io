To understand what _better code_ is we first need to understand what _good code_ is. A new CS grad might claim that good code is code that does what the specification says it should. But such an answer begs the question of what is a good specification? I think every experienced developer has a snippet of code filed away that has profound beauty - it likely has no corresponding specification and may not even contain a single comment.

By working through this book and applying the ideas within I hope that you will gain a deeper understanding of what good code is, and in striving to write good code you will write better code.

This book presents a collection of software development goals. The word _goal_ was chosen carefully. These are not guidelines or rules, and achieving the goal is not always simple or straight forward. Each goal is phrased as a negative, what not to do, but what _to do_ is an open ended challenge. You will find that trying to apply these goals you will fail at times, but you will gain a deeper understanding of your code and learn to write _better code_.

The examples in this book are primarily in C++, this is for two reasons. The majority of my professional career has been spent writing C++ code. I also believe it is the best mainstream language with which to present the ideas within. It comes closest to an ideal language, but at times I will point out some significant shortcomings. The ideas in this book are not limited to the C++ developer, but apply equally if you are programming in any other language. Where I think there is value in illustrating this point I provide examples in other languages [REVISIT: It may just be JavaScript as the other language, as yet undecided].
