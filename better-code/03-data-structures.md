### What is an _incidental_ data structure?

A typical definition for _data structure_ is:

> A _data structure_ is a format for organizing and storing data. {::comment}citation?{:/comment}

However, this definition doesn't define _structure_, instead it replaces it with the synonym _format_. In mathematics, _structure_ is defined as:

> A _structure_ on a set consists of additional entities that, in some manner, relate to the set, endowing the collection with meaning or significance. {::comment}citation?{:/comment}
