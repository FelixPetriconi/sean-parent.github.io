### Table of

{: toc }

## Definitions
### ABI

#### Class Layout
	Do base class members come before or after the derived members?
	Multiple inheritance: left to right? right to left? pack anything cleverly?
	Note this is where the Empty Base Optimization takes place.
#### Calling Conventions
	For Itanium,
		For trivial types, same as C
		For non trivial types:
			1. Allocate space for the class on the stack
			2. The *caller* invokes the copy constructor
			3. The address is passed as a normal argument
			4. The caller invokes the destructor.

	This convention is arbitrary. The only way compiled modules know to behave this way is by adhering to the convention. A precompiled binary cannot (easily? at all?) change its convention without recompiling.

	Triviality of class can determines whether a struct is passed in registers or on the stack; defaulting destructors can break this `~Foo() = default` vs `~Foo() {}`.

Exception Handling

### One Definition Rule (ODR)
[ODR in the Standard](http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.def.odr)
[ODR in cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition#ODR-use)

"Why can't the linker catch these?"

#### ODR-used
I'll make the argument that you already know what ODR-used means, just with a different intuition. To ODR-use a name is to use it in some way that requires the definition to be present at link time. If you've ever gotten a linker error, that means you've ODR-used an entity, and the linker could not find the definition. 

Naturally, then, forward declarations

```cpp
void foo(); // like this,
class T bar(class U u); // or this,
class V;	// or this,
using X = Baz; // or this (since Baz may be incomplete at this line)
```

would *not* constitute ODR-use. By contrast, each of these lines:

```cpp
foo(); // calling a function
T my_t; // declaring a variable of a specific type
```

does constitute ODR-use. And of course, this is not exhaustive. How many ways can you think of to cause a linker error? They're all examples of ODR-using a name.

In summary, you can think of "ODR-used" as "possibly causing a linker error".

**TODO: Cover the cases where this intuition is misguided.**
**TODO: Add some examples with static data members, that's where stuff gets a bit wonky.**
