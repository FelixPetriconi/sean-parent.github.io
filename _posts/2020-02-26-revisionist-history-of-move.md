## History

## Problem

Compare the description for the old [SGI STL LessThanComparable concept](http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/stl/LessThanComparable.html) versus the [C++17 concept](http://eel.is/c++draft/utility.arg.requirements#tab:cpp17.lessthancomparable).

## Proposed Solutions

> We need wording to state that these are requirements for operations with the domain of values passed to the STL component. Borrowing from [the text for input iterators](http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.cpp17#input.iterators-2):
{: .comment }

> The term _domain_ of an operation is used in the ordinary mathematical sense to denote the set of values over which an operation is (required to be) defined. This set can change over time. Each component may place additional requirements on the domain of an operation. These requirements can be inferred from the uses that a component makes of the operation and is generally constrained to those values accessible through the arguments of the operation. \[ _Example:_ The call `find(a, b, x)` is defined only if the value of `a` has the property _p_ defined as follows: `b` has property _p_ and a value `i` has property _p_ if (`*i == x`) or if (`*i != x` and `++i` has property _p_). _â€” end example_ \]

### Option 1

> This option only requires that a moved-from object can be used as an rhs argument to move-assignment only in the case that the object has been moved from and it is a self-move-assignment. It introduces a fixed-point notion to discuss the properties of the moved from value without specifying a specific value and requires that self-move-assignment for the moved-from object is a no-op. This allows for `swap(a, a)` without allowing the generally contradictory `a = move(a)`.
